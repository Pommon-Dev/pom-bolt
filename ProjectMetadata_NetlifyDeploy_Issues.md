# Project Metadata Persistence & Netlify Deployment E2E Flow Issues

## Summary

This document summarizes the testing process and findings related to the end-to-end (e2e) flow for project creation via the `/api/requirements` endpoint, focusing on project persistence in Cloudflare KV storage and deployment to Netlify.

## Testing Process & Observations

1.  **Initial Goal:** Verify the e2e flow: Send a request to `/api/requirements` with a prompt, project name, and Netlify deployment options (including a valid Netlify token). Expected outcome: Project created, code generated, project persisted, code deployed to Netlify, and a response including the Netlify deployment URL.

2.  **Test 1 (`/api/requirements` E2E Attempt):**
    *   **Action:** Sent `POST` request to `https://8bf9ce3a.pom-bolt.pages.dev/api/requirements` with valid Netlify credentials and `shouldDeploy: true`.
    *   **Result:** Received a success response indicating project creation (`projectId: "cabadde1..."`) and archive storage (`archive.key: "project-cabadde1...zip"`).
    *   **Observation:** The response **did not** contain any `deployment` object or Netlify URL, suggesting the deployment step was either skipped or failed silently.

3.  **Investigation 1 (Project Lookup):**
    *   **Action:** Attempted to fetch project details via `POST /api/debug-projects` using the `projectId` (`cabadde1...`).
    *   **Result:** Failed with `{"success":false,"error":"Project not found: cabadde1..."}`.
    *   **Action:** Attempted direct deployment via `POST /api/deploy` using the `projectId` (`cabadde1...`) and Netlify credentials.
    *   **Result:** Failed with `{"error":"Project cabadde1... not found"}`.
    *   **Action:** Attempted direct deployment via `POST /api/deploy` using the full archive key (`project-cabadde1...zip`) as `projectId`.
    *   **Result:** Failed with `{"error":"Project project-cabadde1...zip not found"}`.
    *   **Observation:** The system could not find the project metadata using either the raw UUID or the full archive key via standard project lookup endpoints.

4.  **Investigation 2 (Archive Download):**
    *   **Action:** Attempted to download the archive directly using `GET /api/local-zip/project-cabadde1...zip`.
    *   **Result:** Successfully downloaded a small file (`project.zip`).
    *   **Action:** Inspected the contents of `project.zip`.
    *   **Result:** The file contained JSON: `{"error":"Failed to generate ZIP file","message":"Project not found: cabadde1..."}`.
    *   **Observation:** Although the archive *key* exists in KV, the *value* associated with it indicates the project metadata lookup failed even during the archive generation/retrieval process.

5.  **Investigation 3 (Target & Credential Verification):**
    *   **Action:** Checked target availability via `POST /api/debug-targets` with valid Netlify credentials.
    *   **Result:** Confirmed `netlify` and `cloudflare-pages` were both registered and available. Credentials were detected correctly from environment and request body.
    *   **Action:** Tested Netlify target creation via `POST /api/debug-target-creation` with valid Netlify token.
    *   **Result:** Confirmed success: `"netlifyTargetCreation":{"targetCreated":true,"isAvailable":true,"error":null}`.
    *   **Observation:** The core Netlify target implementation works correctly, and credentials are being detected.

6.  **Investigation 4 (Direct Deployment with Inline Files):**
    *   **Action:** Sent `POST` request to `/api/deploy` providing `files` directly (instead of `projectId`), `targetName: "netlify"`, and valid Netlify credentials.
    *   **Result:** **Successful deployment to Netlify!** Received a response including `"deployment":{"id":"...","url":"https://....netlify.app","status":"success","provider":"netlify"}`.
    *   **Observation:** The Netlify deployment target and the `/api/deploy` endpoint function correctly when *not* relying on project ID lookup.

7.  **Test 2 (`/api/requirements` E2E Attempt - Repeat):**
    *   **Action:** Repeated the initial e2e test with a new project name.
    *   **Result:** Same as Test 1 - project created (`projectId: "edd0a862..."`), archive key returned, but no deployment information.

## Conclusions

1.  **Netlify Deployment Target Works:** The `NetlifyTarget` implementation itself is functional. It can successfully deploy files to Netlify when invoked directly (as seen in Investigation 4).

2.  **Project Metadata Persistence Issue:** The primary blocker is a failure in persisting or retrieving the project *metadata*. While the *archive* key (including UUID, timestamp, `.zip`) is created in KV, the corresponding *metadata* record, expected to be accessible via the bare UUID (`cabadde1...`), is either not being saved correctly or cannot be retrieved by the relevant endpoints (`/api/deploy`, `/api/debug-projects`). The error message inside the downloaded ZIP file strongly suggests the lookup fails early.

3.  **E2E Flow Incomplete:** The `/api/requirements` flow currently stops after successfully generating code and creating the archive key in KV. It does not proceed to the deployment step, even when `shouldDeploy: true` is set and valid Netlify credentials are provided. The deployment result is consequently missing from the final response.

## Next Steps

1.  **Debug Project Metadata Persistence:** Investigate `ProjectStateManager` and `CloudflareProjectStorage` to ensure project metadata (under the bare UUID key) is correctly saved alongside the archive ZIP (under the timestamped key).
2.  **Trace Deployment Execution:** Add detailed logging within the `deployCode` function (and potentially `configureDeploymentManager` and `deployWithBestTarget`) in `requirements-chain.ts` to pinpoint why the deployment step is not executing or completing in the e2e flow.
3.  **Review Context/State Passing:** Ensure that necessary state (like project ID, files, deployment options) is correctly passed from the project creation/code generation phase to the deployment phase within the `requirements-chain` execution.
